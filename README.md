Startup App
==================


**This** is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It follows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a used as a base arctictecture for any android application.


# Architecture Overview

The app architecture has two layers: a [data layer] and a [UI layer].

The architecture follows a reactive programming model with [unidirectional data flow]. With the data layer at the bottom, the key concepts are:

*   Higher layers react to changes in lower layers.
*   Events flow down.
*   Data flows up.

The data flow is achieved using streams, implemented using [Kotlin Flows].

### Example: Displaying Products on the Product screen

When the app is first run it will gives you two option "start fragment flow" and "start compose flow". When you clicked either of the flow then the next product screen will attempt to load a list of product resources from a remote server. Once loaded, these are shown to the user.

The following diagram shows the events which occur and how data flows from the relevant objects to achieve this.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Step</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Code </strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>On app startup, once the user clicked on the "start compose flow" button, then the <code>ProductViewModel</code> calls <code>ProductDataRepository</code> to obtain a stream of product resources. Items will be emitted into this stream when repository emit an item. While waiting, the feed state is set to <code>Loading</code>.
   </td>
   <td>Search for usages of <code>ProductUiState.Loading</code>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>Whenever user clicked on a product then that product is stored in Proto DataStore.
   </td>
   <td><code>AppPreferencesDataSource.productDataStream</code>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3
   </td>
   <td><code>RetrofitNetwork</code> calls the REST API on the remote server.
   </td>
   <td><code>RetrofitNetwork.getProducts</code>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>4
   </td>
   <td><code>RetrofitNetwork</code> receives the network response from the remote server.
   </td>
   <td><code>RetrofitNiaNetwork.getProducts</code>
   </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>5
   </td>
   <td><code>OnlineProductRepository</code> acts as an intermediate operator on this stream, transforming the incoming <code>NetworkProduct</code> to the public <code>Product</code> model which is consumed by other layers.
   </td>
   <td><code>OnlineProductRepository.getProductStream</code>
   </td>
  <tr>
   <td>6
   </td>
   <td>When <code>ProductViewModel</code> receives the product resources it updates the product state to <code>Success</code>.

  <code>ProductScreen</code> then uses the product resources in the state to render the screen.
   </td>
   <td>Search for instances of <code>ProductUiState.Success</code>
   </td>
  </tr>

# Modularization

Modularization is the practice of breaking the concept of a monolithic, one-module codebase into loosely coupled, self contained modules.

This **Startup** app has been fully modularized.

## Types of modules

This app contains the following types of modules:

*   The `app` module - contains app level and scaffolding classes that bind the rest of the codebase, such as `MainActivity`, `App` and app-level controlled navigation. A good example of this is the navigation setup through `AppNavHost`. The `app` module depends on all `feature` modules and required `core` modules.

* `feature:` modules - feature specific modules which are scoped to handle a single responsibility in the app. These modules can be reused by any app. If a class is needed only by one `feature` module, it should remain within that module. If not, it should be extracted into an appropriate `core` module. A `feature` module should have no dependencies on other feature modules. They only depend on the `core` modules that they require.

* `core:` modules - common library modules containing auxiliary code and specific dependencies that need to be shared between other modules in the app. These modules can depend on other core modules, but they shouldnâ€™t depend on feature nor app modules.
